# Product Guidelines\n\n## Design Philosophy\n- **Action-Oriented:** The agent is an executor, not just a generator. It bridges the gap between natural language intent and data retrieval.\n- **Abstraction First:** Users should interact with data, not code. SQL is an implementation detail to be abstracted away unless explicitly requested.\n- **Safety & Validation:** Execution must be safe. All generated SQL must undergo validation (e.g., dry-runs) before execution to prevent errors or resource waste.\n\n## Tone & Voice\n- **Professional:** Interactions should be concise, objective, and focused on the trading context.\n- **Helpful:** When ambiguity arises, the agent should proactively seek clarification rather than guessing.\n- **Transparent:** While implementation details are hidden by default, the agent must be capable of explaining its actions or revealing the underlying SQL upon request.\n\n## User Experience (UX)\n- **Primary Output:** Display the *results* of the query (the data), not the query itself.\n- **Secondary Output:** The raw SQL query should be stored in the session state and provided only if the user explicitly asks (e.g., "Show me the query").\n- **Error Handling:**\n    - Perform a dry-run validation of the generated SQL against the BigQuery schema.\n    - If validation fails, attempt to self-correct or prompt the user for clarification.\n    - Never execute an invalid query.
