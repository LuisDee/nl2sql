# Initial Concept\nNatural language to SQL agent for Mako Group's trading desk. Converts trader questions into BigQuery SQL using YAML metadata catalogs, vector-based semantic search, and validated few-shot examples. Built with Google ADK, Vertex AI embeddings, and BigQuery native vector search. but probably an MCPm toolbox for datases or actually a sub agent called as atool. I am thinking [Pasted Text: 8 lines]\n\n# Product Definition\n\n## Vision\nTo build a specialized Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) agent for Mako Group's trading desk. This agent will function as a sub-agent within a larger Gemini-based AI assistant, empowering traders to retrieve data through natural language questions that are automatically converted into precise, validated BigQuery SQL queries.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Semantic Schema Search:** Utilizes Vertex AI embeddings and BigQuery native vector search to map natural language terms to the correct tables and columns defined in YAML metadata catalogs.\n- **Validated Query Generation:** Leverages a repository of validated few-shot SQL examples to ensure high accuracy and adherence to business logic.\n- **Google ADK Integration:** Built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) for seamless integration into the Gemini ecosystem.\n- **Metadata-Driven:** Driven by structured YAML catalogs that provide context-rich schema definitions for the trading domain.\n\n## Target Audience\n- **Primary:** Traders at Mako Group requiring rapid, self-service access to trading data.\n- **Secondary:** Data Analysts who can use the tool to draft initial queries or verify data availability.\n\n## Core Goals\n- **Empower Traders:** Enable non-technical users to query complex datasets without writing SQL.\n- **Ensure Accuracy:** Minimize hallucination risks by grounding generation in validated metadata and examples.\n- **Streamline Workflow:** Reduce the dependency on data engineering teams for ad-hoc data requests.
