      direction. Equivalent to ABS(size). Convenience field for aggregation queries where direction
      does not matter (e.g., total volume, average trade size). Used in fee calculations and volume
      reporting.

      Boolean flag indicating whether this broker trade occurred on the option's expiry day. Expiry-day
      trades have unique characteristics: gamma is extremely high, theta decay is accelerated, and
      slippage patterns differ from normal trading days. Consider filtering out or segmenting expiry
      trades for more representative performance analysis.
    synonyms:

    - expiry day trade
    - on expiry
    business_rules: Consider segmenting expiry-day trades separately; they have extreme greeks and atypical slippage.
