  kpi_vs_data_general: >
    The nl2sql_omx_kpi dataset (gold layer) has KPI-enriched trade data with
    computed metrics: edge_bps, instant_pnl, slippage, delta_bucket,
    required_edge_bps. The nl2sql_omx_data dataset (silver layer) has raw
    trade and market data with exact timestamps, prices, sizes, and execution
    details. Both datasets share some table names (brokertrade, clicktrade,
    markettrade, quotertrade). When the question asks about performance, edge,
    PnL, or slippage, use kpi. When the question asks about raw execution data,
    exact timestamps, or market data, use data.

  kpi_table_selection: >
    The nl2sql_omx_kpi dataset has 5 tables, one per trade origin: markettrade
    (exchange trades, the default), quotertrade (auto-quoter fills), brokertrade
    (broker trades, has account field for broker comparison), clicktrade (manual
    click trades), otoswing (OTO swing trades). When a question doesn't specify
    trade type, use markettrade. When comparing brokers or mentioning account
    names, use brokertrade. When asking about all trades or total PnL, UNION
    ALL across all 5 tables.

  theodata_routing: >
    Questions about theoretical pricing, implied volatility (IV, vol, sigma),
    delta, vega, gamma, theta, greeks, fair value, machine price, or theo
    should route to nl2sql_omx_data.theodata. This is the ONLY table with
    options pricing theory data. It is in the data dataset, not kpi.

  market_data_routing: >
    Questions about market prices, exchange feeds, top-of-book, or market
    snapshots go to nl2sql_omx_data.marketdata. Questions about order book
    depth, bid/ask levels, or book shape go to nl2sql_omx_data.marketdepth.
    Neither of these exist in the kpi dataset.
