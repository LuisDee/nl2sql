  description: >-
    Exchange/market trade KPIs with time-bucketed slippage and Greeks. This is the DEFAULT table when
    users ask about trades without specifying a trade type — use it for questions about 'how did we do
    on market trades', 'exchange executions', or 'trade performance'. Contains one row per market trade
    execution on the exchange, enriched with instant edge, PnL, and forward-looking slippage decomposed
    into delta, vol, roll, and residual components at intervals from 1 second to end-of-day (plus
    multi-day 1D/5D where available). Source pipeline: Kafka raw proto -> normalize -> join instruments
    -> calculate KPIs -> aggregate combos -> mart. Always filter on trade_date (partition column).
    Cluster fields are symbol and portfolio. NOT for quoter fills, broker trades, click trades, or OTO
    sweep trades — those have separate KPI tables.
  business_context: >
    All market trades from ALL participants (Mako + counterparties). This is the superset —
    Mako's own trades (which appear in quotertrade, brokertrade, clicktrade, otoswing) are
    also included here. Do NOT sum this with Mako-specific KPI tables or you will double-count.

  - name: parent_is_combo
    type: BOOLEAN
    description: >-
      Boolean flag indicating whether this trade's parent instrument is a combo or spread (e.g. straddle,
      strangle, calendar spread). When TRUE, the trade has leg-level detail and a parent row that
      aggregates leg values. Also called is combo. Used to distinguish single-leg from multi-leg trades.
    synonyms:
    - is combo
    - is spread

      For single-leg trades, is_parent is typically FALSE.
